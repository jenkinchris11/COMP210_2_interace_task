Fighting against Motion Sickness
 
 
The game that I chose to do my VR interface for was an old school platformer which would contain a lot of jumping and when jumping in Virtual Reality it can make you quite sick if you are not careful so the idea I have chosen is to do a sort of mini game/playroom where users can exit the game when feeling sick but not have to exit the Virtual Reality experience and can just play short mini games or just throw objects about to pass the time until they feel ready to go back into the platformer. This will include things such as a room where you can throw objects about for entertainment.

This is aiming to battle against motion sickness in games that include a lot of movement, so i intend to create a UI that contains a set of mini games that the user can play while taking a break from the main game.

Researching into motion sickness i found that it is caused by sensory conflict in the vestibular system, motion sickness can make the user experience nausea, headaches and dizziness there has been multiple suggestions for a solution to motion sickness such as pharmaceuticals that can help, there is also suggestions of natural remedies although there is not much information on if they work or not. so in conclusion my interntion is to help people manage experiencing motion sickness while in virtual reality so that they do not have to break the experience.
 

Time Constraints
If i had more time there are multiple elements of this VR Interface i would improve such as having more levels and variation, something like having bowling or darts, i would have made the UI look a little nicer.
